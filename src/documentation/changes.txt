This changelog tracks the general events of the v1.0 branch of the pg-python
project.

1.0 in development
==================

pg-python marks a significant deviation from the original PL/Py direction.

 - Python 3 only
 - Functions [are] Modules; entry point based code execution
 - PEP-302 __loader__'s are used to support tracebacks
 - Uses SPI with some extensions
 - Gets rid of the attempt at a rather confusing abstract Call type
 - Improved Database Access interface (some consistency with py-postgresql)
 - Internal Subtransactions are tracked and ensured complete on handler exit
 - Improved native typing: arrays, composites, composite arrays.
 - Removed HeapTuple interface type in favor of DatumTuples/Postgres.types.record
 - PGXS based build
 - Drops support for 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 (the latter was never released or tagged)
 - Default language name is now "python".
