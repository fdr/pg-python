Administration
==============

The administration of procedural language extensions can be tricky in some
situations. If you have any questions, be sure to contact the mailing list:

 mailto:python-general@pgfoundry.org

.. note::
   This chapter occasionally refers ``$PREFIX``; this is referring to the
   location in which PostgreSQL is installed. When referenced, it is assumed
   that the installation did not modify the directory layout. In the event that
   the distribution or packager did modify the layout, it is important to
   reference the appropriate documentation in order to properly identify the
   corresponding locations.

Compilation
===========

Currently, the only supported compilation method uses PostgreSQL's PGXS
makefile system. For compilation, the Python and PostgreSQL header files are
necessary, so for some platforms, *it is important to install the Python*
*and PostgreSQL developer packages*.

PGXS Build
----------

The first step for PGXS compilation is running the ``configure`` script.
By default, the ``configure`` script identifies the PostgreSQL installation and
the Python installation to use by executing the ``python3`` command and
``pg_config`` command. Whichever ``python3`` and ``pg_config`` executable
comes first in the system's path will be the target installation chosen by
``configure``::

 ./configure

Once configured, the makefile includes have been built, and the
``GNUmakefile``'s functionality will be ready for use::

 # Or "gmake" on some systems.
 make

And finally, to install the built module::

 # Prefix with "sudo", if need be.
 make install

There is only one file that needs to be installed, normally named ``python.so``.
``make install`` will place it in the ``$PREFIX/lib/postgresql`` directory.

Database Installation
=====================

Installation into a database is the last necessary step before a Python
``FUNCTION`` can be created. This is normally done by executing the following
commands::

 BEGIN;
 CREATE SCHEMA __python__;
 SET search_path TO __python__;
 CREATE FUNCTION handler() RETURNS LANGUAGE_HANDLER
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python', 'pl_handler';
 CREATE FUNCTION validator(oid) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python', 'pl_validator';
 CREATE FUNCTION inline(INTERNAL) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python', 'pl_inline';
 CREATE LANGUAGE python
  HANDLER handler INLINE inline VALIDATOR validator;
 COMMIT;

The distinct schema is used hold the functions and for future expansion.

.. tip::
   If a language is installed into ``template1``, all subsequently
   created databases will have the language installed automatically.

The above commands will only work if the extension module is installed into
PostgreSQL's library directory. Normally, ``$PREFIX/lib/postgresql``. In cases
where the extension does not exist in the default location, a full path to the
library will need to be given to the ``CREATE FUNCTION`` commands::

 BEGIN;
 CREATE SCHEMA __python__;
 SET search_path TO __python__;
 CREATE FUNCTION handler() RETURNS LANGUAGE_HANDLER
  LANGUAGE C AS '/full/path/to/python', 'pl_handler';
 CREATE FUNCTION validator(oid) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS '/full/path/to/python', 'pl_validator';
 CREATE FUNCTION inline(INTERNAL) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS '/full/path/to/python', 'pl_inline';
 CREATE LANGUAGE python
  HANDLER handler INLINE inline VALIDATOR validator;
 COMMIT;

Configuration
=============

pg-python does not require any additional configuration once installed.
However, much initialization overhead can be eliminated by preloading
the extension using the ``shared_preload_libraries`` configuration parameter.

Specifically::

 shared_preload_libraries = 'python'

Using this will cause Python to be initialized when Postgres is started.

Local Initialization
--------------------

When Python is loaded, the ``init.py`` file in the data directory will be executed if it
exists. The contents of this file will be executed in a new module named
``__pg_init__``. The module is stored in ``sys.modules``, but primarily for
identifying that an ``init.py`` file was loaded.

The primary purpose of the initialization file is to allow modules to be
preloaded when the server is started. Writing functions that
depend on objects created by ``init.py`` should be avoided.

For ``init.py`` to provide any savings, it should be used
in conjunction with the ``shared_preload_libraries`` configuration parameter.

.. note:: When ``init.py`` is loaded, database access is prohibited.

Managing Multiple Versions
==========================

.. warning::
   This section covers advanced material.

In some situations, it may be necessary to have multiple builds of pg-python
installed in the same PostgreSQL installation for upgrade purposes. When such
cases arise, using a distinct name for the language is necessary.

There are two routes that can be taken. The first is to rename the existing
language making room for the new one, and the second is to use a different name
for the new version. The best path depends on the situation.

Renaming the Existing Language
------------------------------

Renaming the existing language is the proper choice when there is an
incompatibility between the existing language and the new *target* language.
Functions can then be incrementally ported to the new version as time permits.

.. note::
   Renaming the existing language may require restart of the cluster.

The first step in renaming the existing language is to copy the
original ``python.so`` so that it's name is distinct from the
one that is going to be installed. This can be done while the cluster is
running::

 cd /pgprefix/lib/postgresql/
 cp python.so python31.so

The second step is to create the new language object. It is recommended to name
it after the specific version of Python being used::

 BEGIN;
 CREATE SCHEMA __python31__;
 SET search_path = __python31__;
 CREATE FUNCTION handler() RETURNS LANGUAGE_HANDLER
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python31', 'pl_handler';
 CREATE FUNCTION validator(oid) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python31', 'pl_validator';
 CREATE FUNCTION inline(INTERNAL) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python31', 'pl_inline';
 CREATE LANGUAGE python31
  HANDLER handler INLINE inline VALIDATOR validator;
 COMMIT;

Next, the existing functions need to have their language updated::

 UPDATE pg_catalog.pg_proc
 SET prolang = (SELECT oid FROM pg_language WHERE lanname = 'python31')
 WHERE prolang = (SELECT oid FROM pg_language WHERE lanname = 'python');

.. warning::
   It is best not to have other backends running while the above command is
   running.

And finally, the old language should be removed in order to make room for the
new default::

 SET search_path = __python__;
 DROP FUNCTION handler();
 DROP FUNCTION validator(oid);
 DROP FUNCTION inline(internal);
 RESET search_path;
 DROP SCHEMA __python__;

With those steps complete, the language has been renamed, and the new language
may be installed using the steps documented in `Compilation`_ and
`Database Installation`_.

Using a Custom Name for the New Language
----------------------------------------

Using a custom name for the new language is the proper choice when necessary
functionality is exclusively available in a past version of Python. Such cases
are likely transient, but when they occur, they are best handled as an
exception.

Using a custom name for the language is significantly easier renaming an
existing language. All that is required is that the built ``python.so``
file be manually into the ``$PREFIX/lib/postgresql`` directory under a new
name::

 cp python.so $PREFIX/lib/postgresql/python31.so

Once complete, database installation can then be performed with a slight
modification::

 BEGIN;
 CREATE SCHEMA __python31__;
 CREATE FUNCTION handler() RETURNS LANGUAGE_HANDLER
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python31', 'pl_handler';
 CREATE FUNCTION validator(oid) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python31', 'pl_validator';
 CREATE FUNCTION inline(INTERNAL) RETURNS VOID
  LANGUAGE C AS 'python31', 'pl_inline';
 CREATE LANGUAGE python31
  HANDLER handler INLINE inline VALIDATOR validator;
 COMMIT;

Complete. The ``python31`` language will be ready for use alongside any others.
