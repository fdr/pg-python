pg-python is a Python procedural language extension for PostgreSQL.

If the environment is configured to meet pg-python's expectations, the following
should work::

 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install
 psql -f src/install.sql

It assumes the *target* pg_config and python3 executables are in $PATH.

See src/documentation/admin.txt for detailed instructions on
compilation and database installation.
